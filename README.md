## Introduction to Docker

### What is Docker?
Docker is a popular tool for deploying and managing applications in containers. Containers allow you to package an application and its dependencies into a single, portable unit that can be easily moved between different environments. This tutorial is designed to help beginners get started with Docker and Docker Swarm, a tool for orchestrating a cluster of Docker nodes.

### Installing Docker
Before you can use Docker, you need to install it on your system. You can find installation instructions for your specific platform in the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

### Basic Docker Concepts

Docker uses images to run containers. An image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the application code, libraries, dependencies, and runtime. You can think of an image as a blueprint for a container.

To run an image in a container, you can use the `docker run` command. For example:

`docker run <image_name> <command> `

This command will create a new container from the specified image, and run the specified command in the container.

## Managing Docker containers

### Running a Container

To run a container, you can use the `docker run` command. For example:

`docker run <image_name> <command> `

This command will create a new container from the specified image, and run the specified command in the container.

### Attaching to a Running Container

To attach to a running container, you can use the `docker attach` command. For example:

`docker attach <container_id> `

This command will attach your terminal to the specified container

### Copying Files from a Container

To copy files from a container, you can use the `docker cp` command. For example:

`docker cp <container_id>:<src_path> <dest_path> `

This command will copy the file at `src_path` in the container to `dest_path` on the host machine.

### Creating a New Container

To create a new container, you can use the `docker create` command. For example:

`docker create <image_name> <command> `

This command will create a new container from the specified image, but it will not start the container. To start the container, you can use the `docker start` command.

### Viewing Changes to the Filesystem

To view the changes made to the filesystem of a container, you can use the `docker diff` command. For example:

`docker diff <container_id> `

This command will show the changes made to the container's filesystem since it was created.

### Inspecting a Container

To view detailed information about a container, you can use the `docker inspect` command. For example:

`docker inspect <container_id> `

This command will display detailed information about the specified container, including its configuration, state, and resource usage.

### Killing a Container

To stop a running container, you can use the `docker kill` command. For example:

`docker kill <container_id>`

This command will send a SIGKILL signal to the container,

## Introduction to Docker Swarm

## Working with Swarm services

## Working with Swarm nodes

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, you learned the basics of Docker and Docker Swarm, and how to use them to create and manage a cluster of Docker nodes. You learned how to run and manage Docker containers, how to work with Docker images, how to use container networking, and how to deploy and manage applications with Docker Swarm.

I hope this tutorial has been helpful in getting you started with Docker and Docker Swarm, and that you feel confident using these tools to build and deploy your own applications. Let me know if you have any questions or if there is anything else I can help with.
